TO DO: 

	Prevent object selection outside of active layer.


----------------------------ROADMAP-----------------------

Here I have outlined the core features of this app. Any features other than the ones outlined 
below should be considered secondary. This document exists to track current application progress
and prevent scope creep. 

SCOPE:
	
	MapMan is primarily a scene-builder and should support the following features:

		- Scene / Stage organization
		- Layer / Group organization within each stage
		- Tools to adjust object position / scale / rotation 
		- Property Editor
		- Basic Custom Object types
		- Basic Prefab / Template support
		- JSON export

STRUCTURE:

	Note: 	As opposed to having one complicated project file holding all the objects, scenes, asset paths, settings, etc, 
			I'd like for everything to be more modular and based on loading / unloading scenes. The project file should only
			contain editor settings and project-specific data such as the publish path. Each scene file should be self-contained. 
			Object/Definition files should be loaded on project load, however;

BUGS:
