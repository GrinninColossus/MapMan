# MapMan
**This project was primarly an experiment/learning exercise and is not in active development.**

MapMan is a scene editor for [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) with tools to modify position/scale/orientation and properties of phaser display
objects. Each scene graph is exported as a json and parsed via a MapMan plugin for Phaser. Optionally, MapMan can also handle basic loading
of image assets for each scene.
